Hello,

This project is built with SQLite instead of SQL Server and the necessary code is provided in program.cs to start the app from the get go without running database update

Aim for this app is to allow users to add identities with required information which we have all encountered in real world in one place or another,
Also to define connections between the added individuals if necessary

Image field is listed as string just to allow basic input of relative file location in the system
